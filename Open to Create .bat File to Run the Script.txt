Here is an example where a Python exe is located: "C:\Users\Ron\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python.exe"

And here is an example where a Python script is located:
"C:\Users\Ron\Desktop\Test\daily_water.py"

A new batch file, called "daily_water.bat" will be created at your specified location.


Finally, double-click on the batch file in order to run the Python script.
